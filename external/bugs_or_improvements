BUG 1
treeWalk.isSubtree() do not recognized names in folders like "FB-Elevator-Antenna-v1.4". It is treat like a file.

Important Bug:
We must not link Features with Fragments like normal relations because some fragment depends on being active from a set of features.
For this reason, we need a virtual link and not a strict relation in Database.
It needs to take the order of the bit, as we explained before.

Important Bug:
The algorithm needs to improve in reducing the number of fragments and creating features.
It is because, in some parts, the "else"  points to a known fragment, but in the generation, it is not part of the product.
Consider adding an imaginary universe and the new calculations with that universe set to improve the algorithm.

Improvement.
Now instead of listing features with fragments.
List a set of features with fragments associated or calculated from the list. Alternatively, since we have a list of products,
take a product and calculate the list of fragments.

Add new Command.
List features by bit order.
